Lone Fox Dancing

As I walked home last night
I saw a lone fox dancing
In the cold moonlight.

I stood and watched. Then
Took the low road, knowing
The night was his by right.

Sometimes, when words ring true,
Iâ€™m like a lone fox dancing
In the morning dew.
 
            
Dirge of Dehra Dun

I wonder where the green grass went,
All buried under the new cement.
I wonder where the birds have flown,
They have gone to find another home.

                 ~ Ruskin Bond
